App Inventor convenience scripts

#deploy_appspot.sh 
Deploys your instance to Appspot. Requires app id to be edited in the script.
Will prompt for username and password interactively.

#deploy_buildserver.sh
Starts the build server on its public-accessible server, for real.
To be run ON the build server machine, not the local dev machine!
The expectation is the build server has a full git clone of the project.

#start_server.sh
Starts the local dev server, on your workstation.
